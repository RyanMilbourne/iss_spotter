# ISS SPOTTER

Wouldn't it be awesome if we could figure out when the ISS is passing overhead?

Lucky for you, when you use the `ISS SPOTTER` you can figure that out!

Using your IP address and some useful API's, the ISS spotter can print out a set of useful dates and times **AND** *how long* the ISS glides above you.

## How to use
Simply run `index.js` in your terminal and let the magic happen.
